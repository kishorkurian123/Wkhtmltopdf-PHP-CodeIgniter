# Wkhtmltopdf-PHP-CodeIgniter
Wkhtmltopdf PHP wrapper made suitable to work with Codeigniter

Orginal PHP Wrapper is from :

https://github.com/aur1mas/Wkhtmltopdf/

I just had to tweak it a littlebit to get it up and running with Code Igniter.

#Installation and Use

I have written a simple how to here : http://repulsor.me/installing-wkhtmltopdf-and-using-wkhtmltopdf-in-codeigniter/

Hope this will be useful.
